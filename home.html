    <h1><u>The Positive impacts of Computers on Society</u></h1>
    <p>Computers have revolutionised society since their creation, acting as the driving force to propel the world forth into the modern era.</p>
    <p>Among the countless ways they have managed to imporve society, here are 4 examples of what they have managed to achieve so far:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="page1.html" >Healthcare </a></li>
        <li><a href="page2.html" >Code breaking </a></li>
        <li><a href="page 3.html" >Communication </a></li>
        <li><a href="page4.html" >Economic development </a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have had computers for less than 100 years, yet they have already managed to change the world so much.</p>
    <p>Just imagine how great our world could be after another 100 years of what is quite possibly man's greatest invention yet.</p>
