REVIEW BY DOM, HAYSIE AND DEVASHY
Pros:
 - Consistent navigation bar on all of the pages
 - Good, consistent styling 
 - Appealing aesthetic with colour and textboxes
 - Good use of images

Cons:
 - Very left-centered, with blank space on the right side
 - All subheadings are the same size as the page heading
 - The home page could be styled slightly differently to stand out more from the other pages
