    <h1><u>Code Breaking</u></h1>
    <p>Throughout the history of war, many have realised that one of the most powerful things a nation can wield is intelligence. Blindly charging into battle with no plan or tactics and no idea of what you are up against is a fool's errand - one that practically guarantees defeat.</p>
    <p>There is one major flaw with this - when your men are spread out across vast distances, with the enemy lying in wait between you, how can you send a message without giving everything away in the case of capture?</p>
    <p>This is what lead to the invention of ciphers - algorithms which can hide the meaning of a message, but in a way where a reverse algorithm can reveal the original information</p>
    <br>
    <h1><u>Early ciphers</u></h1>
    <p>One of the simplest ciphers is the Caeser cipher. This cipher works by simply shifting every letter in the alphabet by a number, and writing the message using this. A cipher like this is useful as it makes the plaintext completely illegible to any reader, yet does not require much effort to encrypt or decrypt</p>
    <p>This is also its distinct disadvantage - its simplicity makes it laughably easy to decrypt even when the key - the number by which the alphabet is shifted - is not known. This completely defeats the purpose of the cipher, making it useless.</p>
    <p>If we truly want to obscure information from those we do not want to read it, we have to do more than this.</p>
