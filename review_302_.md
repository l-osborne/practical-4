Good overall website. Content was interesting for most part considering some more unique applications of computing particularly codebreaking and the economy.

Good consisitency overall. Website flow was good and theme was consistent on all pages, consisten color scheme and text formatting.

Quality of presentation was decent but could use some better formatting to make use of the full page: most pages had all the information on the left side and blank empty space on the right

HTML is perfectly valid and works well functionally, but could benefit from indentation sometimes to make it more readable

Evidence of collaboration given as each page has a named author evidencing who wrote it.
